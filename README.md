# Employee Directory React

This app takes an employee directory and makes it searchable by a variety of fields. In addition, the list of employees can be sorted by name.

## Motivation

This was a great HW assignment for learning the basics of React and how to hack away and get actual functionality.

## Code

Most of the code is obviously Javascript. A lot of packages were installed and you can find them in package.json. Basic React techniques were used to create a parent-child relationship.
